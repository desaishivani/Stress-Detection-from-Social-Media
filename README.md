# Stress-Detection-from-Social-Media
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting stress from social media posts using NLP and deep learning techniques. The project explores different machine learning models, including XGBoost, Decision Tree, and SVM, for binary classification of text data.

## Project Overview
Stress detection plays a crucial role in understanding mental well-being and providing actionable insights for various stakeholders. This project addresses the challenge of identifying stress-related text content using labeled datasets from Reddit and Twitter.

### Business Goal
Develop an automated system to classify social media posts as stress-positive or stress-negative.
Provide benchmarks for future research in computational stress detection.
### Key Features
Preprocessing: Text cleaning, stopword removal, stemming, and tokenization.
Balanced Dataset: Applied SMOTE to address class imbalances.
ML Models: XGBoost with BERT embeddings (accuracy: 94%) and comparative analysis of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM models.
Visualization: Word clouds, topic modeling, and evaluation metrics like confusion matrices and ROC curves.
